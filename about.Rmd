title: "Miscellaneous information"

* I am an avid reader. I plan to start a blog soon containing the reviews of books I am currently reading/ have read.

* In my free time, I usually play the piano. You can find a video of me playing Ludovico Einaudi's "Nuvole Bianche" here.

* I am currently learning to play the guitar. Phew! Fingers hurt.

* One thing that I am really proud of is having overcome my water and thus swimming fear. I have been scared of swimming since my early childhood, but only this year (2021) have I started facing my fears and I can now freestyle and backstroke!
